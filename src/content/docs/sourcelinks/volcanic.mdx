The Volcanic Sourcelink generates source from burning fuel items.

| Max Source | Transfer Rate | Event Range (Blocks) | Event Interval (Seconds) |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 20000      | 10000         | 1                    | 1                        |

## Source Per Item

| Item Type            | Source Generated     | Progress |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| Fire Essence         | 2000                 | 1        |
| Blazing Archwood Log | 125                  | 6        |
| Archwood Log[^1]     | 75                   | 4        |
| Other Fuel           | `duration / 12`[^2]  | 1        |

## Block Conversion

When the total progress of the Volcanic Sourcelink reaches certain values, blocks in a 3x3x3 area around it may change.

It is possible but not advisable to use this as a way to generate Lava due to Dripstone and Cauldrons being both easier and faster.

| From                 | To               | Progress Used |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Stones[^3]           | Magma Block      | 150           |
| Magma Block          | Lava             | 200           |

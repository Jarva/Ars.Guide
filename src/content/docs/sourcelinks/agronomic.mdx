The Agronomic Sourcelink generates source from crop and tree growth. 

Due to their low productivity, it is generally not advisable to use Agronomic Sourcelinks as your main method of source production.
It is most commonly used to sustainably power a Harvest Ritual while also generating a small surplus.

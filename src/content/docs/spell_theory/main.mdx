# What is an I-Frame


An "i-frame" (short for invulnerability frame) refers to a short window during which an entity (usually the player) becomes invulnerable after being hit.

In minecraft, the default duration is of approximately 0.5 second, except for certain effects such as poison that at higher level start to attack every tick.

## How does bypassing I-Frames increase damage ?

Here is a table showing the damage of the "poison" effect, and showing how bypassing iframes can lead to a more potent source of damage :

| Potion Level | Invulnerability Duration | Damage Per Second |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
|      01      | 25 total ticks           |      0.4*❤*second |
|      02      | 25 total ticks           |     0.83*❤*second |
|      03      | 25 total ticks           |     1.66*❤*second |
|      04      | 25 total ticks           |     3.33*❤*second |
|      05+     | 25 total ticks           |     10.0*❤*second |
## How does having multiple damage sources in one tick work ?

It is important to note that if multiple hits (or damage source) apply at the same exact tick, meaning that the player was not invulnerable, then the **source with the highest damage** will be picked and applied to the player, discarding the others.

# Ars Nouveau and I-Frames

In ars nouveau, depending on your Mod selection, you can (or not) bypass iframes rather easily.

Here is a table showcasing most of the known methods of bypassing I-Frames :

## Other ways to bypass I-Frames

Certain mods (such as ["iron's RPG tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irons-rpg-tweaks)") allow players to bypass I-Frames (can also use tags to filter which attacks bypass frames)
